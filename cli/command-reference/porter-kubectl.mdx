title: "porter kubectl"
---

##### Prerequisites

* You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
* You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You have `kubectl` installed locally. See [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).

`porter kubectl` is a wrapper around the `kubectl` CLI tool that automatically sets the correct [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) for your configured Porter cluster, in the form:

```
porter kubectl -- [kubectl commands] [kubectl args]

```

For example, if with `kubectl` you would do something like:

```
kubectl get pods -n prod

```

The above would translate to the following:

```
porter kubectl -- get pods -n prod

```
