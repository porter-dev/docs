title: "Basic Usage"
---

To set up and authenticate with the CLI, run the following command:

```
porter auth login

```

This command will automatically set a project ID and a cluster ID in your default configuration file, if you have a project and cluster. You can always view your default configuration by running `porter config`. You can see all projects that you have access to by running:

```
porter projects list

```

And you can set a project via:

```
porter config set-project [PROJECT_ID]

```

Next, you can see all clusters that you have access to via:

```
porter clusters list

```

And similarly, you can set the cluster:

```
porter config set-cluster [CLUSTER_ID]

```

One useful way to make sure that you have access to a cluster is by running:

```
porter cluster namespace list

```

## Environment Variables and Global Flags[](#environment-variables-and-global-flags "Direct link to heading")

The following environment variables can be set in order to authenticate to and target a specific Porter instance, project, or cluster:

```
PORTER_PROJECT
PORTER_CLUSTER
PORTER_HOST
PORTER_TOKEN

```

These are also supported as global flags:

```
--cluster uint   cluster ID of Porter cluster
--host string    host URL of Porter instance (default "https://dashboard.getporter.dev")
--project uint   project ID of Porter project
--token string   token for Porter authentication

```

## Viewing Help Instructions[](#viewing-help-instructions "Direct link to heading")

You can view help instructions for any command via the `-h`, or `--help` flag. For example:

```
porter -h
porter cluster -h
porter cluster namespace -h

```

## Cloudflare Authentication[](#cloudflare-authentication "Direct link to heading")

If your Porter instance is self-hosted and sits behind Cloudflare, see [this guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/cli) to get a Cloudflare access token. Then run the following:

```
export PORTER_CF_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-cf-token>

```
