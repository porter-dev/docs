title: "porter helm"

##### Prerequisites

* You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
* You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
* You have `helm` installed locally. See [Install helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

`porter helm` is a wrapper around the `helm` CLI tool that automatically sets the correct [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) for your configured Porter cluster, in the form:

```
porter helm -- [helm commands] [helm args]

```

For example, if with `helm` you would do something like:

```
helm list

```

The above would translate to the following:

```
porter helm -- list

```
