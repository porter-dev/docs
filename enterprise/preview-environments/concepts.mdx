This document describes the various concepts used in Porter preview environments.

## Environment[](#environment "Direct link to heading")

A Porter preview environment essentially corresponds to a GitHub repository. Under the hood, Porter creates a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) named `preview` in your GitHub repository to deploy changes via open pull requests. A list of all deployments can be viewed at `https://github.com/<username>/<repository>/deployments/activity_log?environment=preview`.

## Deployment[](#deployment "Direct link to heading")

A preview environment deployment is a collection of apps and addons on Porter. For every pull request in your repository that has Porter preview environments enabled, a new deployment is created with every change to the pull request's head branch.

##### TLDR

An `Environment` is to a GitHub repository just like a `Deployment` is to a pull request in that repository.

## `porter.yaml` file[](#porteryaml-file "Direct link to heading")

To enable deployments to Porter preview environments, you must add a `porter.yaml` file to the root directory of your GitHub repository. A detailed reference can be found in the [Porter YAML Reference](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference) document.

## Resource[](#resource "Direct link to heading")

A resource is the basic building block of a `porter.yaml` file and describes the steps to build and deploy the same to Porter. Resources contain information about the kind of Porter release they build.

### Resource Dependencies[](#resource-dependencies "Direct link to heading")

A resource may depend on one or more resources. The resource(s) that a resource depends on will be executed before it.

## Driver[](#driver "Direct link to heading")

A driver instructs a resource to act in a certain way. For example, the default driver ([deploy](/preview-environments/drivers/deploy)) can build and deploy an app or addon to Porter. On another hand, the [os-env](/preview-environments/drivers/os-env) driver helps to read environment variables from the current operating system environment.

### Driver Configuration[](#driver-configuration "Direct link to heading")

Every driver expects a configuration section (in the form of [<resource>.config](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourceconfig)) in the `porter.yaml` file. This section may be different for different drivers and provides it with the information required to carry out its operation over the resource attached to the driver.

### Driver Outputs[](#driver-outputs "Direct link to heading")

A driver may choose to output one or more identifiers/variables that can be used by other resources to get information of a previous step.

**Note:** A resource can access the output of another resource only when the former depends on the latter.
