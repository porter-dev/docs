Managed add-ons are pre-configured infrastructure components that Porter installs and maintains for you. These add-ons are automatically updated and monitored as part of your cluster.

## System Add-ons

Porter automatically installs and manages several system-level add-ons that are essential for cluster operation:

| Add-on | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Ingress Controller** | Routes external traffic to your services |
| **Certificate Manager** | Automatically provisions and renews TLS certificates |
| **Metrics Server** | Provides resource metrics for autoscaling |
| **Cluster Autoscaler** | Scales node groups based on workload demand |

These add-ons are managed by Porter and do not require manual configuration.

## Optional Managed Add-ons

In addition to system add-ons, Porter offers optional managed add-ons that you can enable for your cluster:

### Observability Stack

Porter can deploy a managed observability stack including:
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for dashboards and visualization

### Logging

Porter can configure centralized logging to aggregate logs from all your applications.

## Viewing Managed Add-ons

To view the managed add-ons installed on your cluster:

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure** in your Porter dashboard
2. System add-ons are managed automatically and visible in the cluster configuration

<Info>
Managed add-ons are updated during [cluster upgrades](/cloud-accounts/cluster-upgrades). Porter tests compatibility before rolling out updates.
