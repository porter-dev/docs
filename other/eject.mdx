title: "Eject from Porter Cloud"
---

Porter deploys your applications into your own AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud account the exact same way it deploys your applications on the Porter Cloud. 
This guide will walk you through how to eject from the Porter Cloud to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account.

# Step 1: Provision Infrastructure

The first step to ejecting your applications is to grant Porter permissions to your cloud account so it can create the necessary underlying infrastructure. Select the **Bring your own Cloud** option from our [website](https://porter.run) and [follow this guide](/provision/overview) to provision
the required infrastructure in your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud account.

# Step 2: Export your applications as a `porter.yaml` file.

While we wait for your infrastructure to be created, head over to your applications on the [Porter Cloud](https://cloud.porter.run) and navigate to the **Settings** tab. You will see an option to **Export** your application into a `porter.yaml` file.
Click on that button, and copy/paste the content of the `porter.yaml` file into the root folder of your repository. You can also put this file in any directory as long as the build context included in your `porter.yaml` file is correct.

# Step 3: Import applications into your own cloud account

Once the `porter.yaml` file is ready and is present in the root folder of your repository, head back to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.porter.run) and deploy a new application from your github repository. 
Porter will detect your `porter.yaml` file and replicate your application.

For a step by step guide on how to do this, [please follow this guide](deploy/deploy-from-github-repo).

# Step 4: Switch over DNS

The final step is to switch over your production traffic by changing your DNS records. Navigate to your DNS provider and edit the CNAME or A record that is pointing at your original application on Porter Cloud to point at the new IP address.
You can find the Load Balancer's IP address to point at in the **Networking** tab of your application. Refer to [this guide](/configure/custom-domains) for more details. This switchover may incur downtime. In most cases, it should not incur more than
5 minutes of downtime especially if you keep the original application running on the Porter Cloud; however, we recommend switching over during your low-traffic hours.
