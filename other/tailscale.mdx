title: "Tailscale on Porter"
---

Tailscale is a VPN that creates a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances. Unlike many other VPNs, setting up a new network on Tailscale requires minimal user configuration and virtually no experience with networking.
To learn more about how Tailscale works under the hood, you can check out this [excellent overview](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/?ref=blog.porter.run) on their official blog.

We will be deploying a Tailscale "subnet router" which will allow any services deployed on your Porter cluster to be accessible over the Tailscale network (Tailnet).

## Setting up Tailscale

### Creating an Oauth Client

1. In the Tailscale admin dashboard, navigate to `Access controls` tab.

2. Add the following annotations to the policy file:

```yaml
	"tagOwners": {
		"tag:k8s-operator": [],
		"tag:k8s":          ["tag:k8s-operator"],
	},
```

3. Click `Save` button to save the changes.

4. Navigate to `Settings -> OAuth clients -> "Generate Oauth client..."`

5. Select the `Core` and `Auth keys` scopes with write permissions. Click on "Add tags" and ensure that the `k8s-operator` tag is selected.

6. Click `Generate client` and save the credentials for later.

### Enabling VPN on your cluster

1. On the Porter dashboard, navigate to the cluster where you want to enable Tailscale and go to `Infrastructure -> Cluster -> VPN`

2. Input the OAuth client id and secret you generated previously.

3. Once the dashboard confirms the credentials are configured, click on "Enable VPN" and update your cluster.

4. The cluster will update and once it's finished, you should be able to see the cluster and tailscale operator in your tailnet.

### Adding Routes to your Tailnet

By default, every time that you click "Update" on your cluster from the `Infrastructure` tab, Porter will ensure that all of your Porter-managed applications and Datastores are accessbile over the Tailnet.
As each route is added, it must be approved by an admin in the Tailscale Admin Panel.

1. Visit your [Tailscale Admin Panel](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines?ref=blog.porter.run)
2. Click on `Machines`
3. Click on the `ABC-subnet-router-relay`, where `ABC` is the name that you gave the Tailscale addon on Porter
4. Click on the 3 dots on the right side of the `ABC-subnet-router-relay`, click `Review Route Settings`

5. Click `Approve All` to approve all routes

6. If you intend to use `porter app run` or `porter datastore connect` commands, also check `Use as Exit Node`.

Your Tailscale Subnet Router should now be online. All of your Porter applications and Datastores should be accessible over the Tailnet.

### Installing Tailscale Addon

<Warning>
  The Tailscale addon is deprecated and no longer supported. Use the
  cluster-level VPN Settings for Tailscale integration, which provides
  additional features and finer-grained permissions through OAuth clients. If
  you're currently using the Tailscale addon, follow the migration steps above
  to transition to the new integration method.
