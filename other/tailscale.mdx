title: "Tailscale on Porter"
---

Tailscale is a VPN that creates a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances. Unlike many other VPNs, setting up a new network on Tailscale requires minimal user configuration and virtually no experience with networking. 
To learn more about how Tailscale works under the hood, you can check out this [excellent overview](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works/?ref=blog.porter.run) on their official blog.

We will be deploying a Tailscale "subnet router" which will allow any services deployed on your Porter cluster to be accessible over the Tailscale network (Tailnet).


## Setting up Tailscale

3. Paste the API key from above into the `Tailscale Auth Key` field, then click `Deploy`


### Adding Routes to your Tailnet

By default, every time that you click "Provision" on your cluster from the `Infrastructure` tab, Porter will ensure that all of your Porter-managed applications and Datastores are accessbile over the Tailnet.
As each route is added, it must be approved by an admin in the Tailscale Admin Panel.

1. Visit your [Tailscale Admin Panel](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines?ref=blog.porter.run)
2. Click on `Machines`
3. Click on the `ABC-subnet-router-relay`, where `ABC` is the name that you gave the Tailscale addon on Porter
4. Click on the 3 dots on the right side of the `ABC-subnet-router-relay`, click `Review Route Settings`
![Tailscale API Key](/images/other/tailscale-machines.png)
5. Click `Approve All` to approve all routes

6. If you intend to use `porter app run` or `porter datastore connect` commands, also check `Use as Exit Node`.

Your Tailscale Subnet Router should now be online. All of your Porter applications and Datastores should be accessible over the Tailnet.
