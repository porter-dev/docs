This is a quick guide on deploying Strapi to a Kubernetes cluster in AWS/GCP/DO using Porter. This guide uses PostgresDB by default - to customize your database settings, modify the files in `/app/config/env/production` in the [example repository](https://github.com/porter-dev/strapi).

## Quick Deploy[](#quick-deploy "Direct link to heading")

### Deploying Strapi[](#deploying-strapi "Direct link to heading")

1. Create an account on [Porter](https://dashboard.getporter.dev).
2. [Provision a Kubernetes cluster](/getting-started/provisioning-infrastructure) in a cloud provider of your choice, or [connect an existing cluster.](/cli/command-reference/porter-connect)
3. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/porter-dev/strapi).
4. From the [Launch tab](https://dashboard.getporter.dev/launch), navigate to **Web Service > Deploy from Git Repository**. Then select the forked repository and `Dockerfile` in the root directory.
5. Configure the port to `1337`, add environment variable `NODE_ENV=production`, and set resources to the [recommended settings](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.html#general-guidelines) (i.e. 2048Mi RAM, 1000 CPU).
6. Hit Deploy!

### Deploying PostgresDB[](#deploying-postgresdb "Direct link to heading")

1. Strapi instance deployed through Porter connects to PostgresDB. You can connect Strapi instance deployed on Porter to any external database, but it is also possible to use a database that is also deployed on Porter. Follow [this guide to deploy a PostgresDB instance to your cluster in one click](https://docs.porter.run/deploying-addons/postgresql).
2. After the database has been deployed, navigate to the **Environment Variables** tab of your deployed Strapi instance. Configure the following environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_HOST=
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=
DATABASE_USERNAME=
DATABASE_PASSWORD=

```

For details on how to connect to the deployed database, [see this guide](https://docs.porter.run/deploying-addons/postgresql#connecting-to-the-database).

## Development[](#development "Direct link to heading")

To develop, clone this repository to your local environment and run `npm install && npm run develop;` from the `app` directory. Porter will automatically handle CI/CD and propagate your changes to production on every push to the repository.
