title: "v1 and v2"
---

We are currently rolling out a new deployment experience (v2) that simplifies how you deploy applications to Porter. The v2 flow features improved application detection, a streamlined configuration interface, and better defaults for production workloads.

**v2** is the new experience we are actively developing. It will become the default for all projects soon.

**v1** is the current stable experience that existing users are familiar with.

Both versions are fully supported. If you're setting up a new project, we recommend trying v2. Existing projects can continue using v1 without any changes.
