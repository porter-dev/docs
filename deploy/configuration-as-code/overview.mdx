## Getting Started with `porter.yaml`

Writing a `porter.yaml` for your app is a great way to maintain a single source of truth on how your app should be built and deployed. Though this file is not required, it can reduce the time it takes to get started with a Porter app.
Once you start creating your app in Porter and select a Github repository, Porter will automatically read your `porter.yaml` to prepopulate settings for your app's services.

The configuration defined in `porter.yaml` takes precedent over any settings you configure in the Porter dashboard. For that reason, any values which are set in `porter.yaml` are read-only in the Porter dashboard.

### Example `porter.yaml`

The following is an example of a v2 `porter.yaml` file, which is the latest version of the spec. This example covers many of the available fields, but not all of them. For a full list of configurable options, see the [full reference](/deploy/configuration-as-code/reference).

```yaml
version: v2
name: my-app

services:
  - name: api
    type: web
    run: node index.js
    port: 8080
    cpuCores: 0.1
    ramMegabytes: 256
    autoscaling:
      enabled: true
      minInstances: 1
      maxInstances: 3
      memoryThresholdPercent: 60
      cpuThresholdPercent: 60
    private: false
    domains:
      - name: test1.example.com
    healthCheck:
      enabled: true
      httpPath: /healthz
  - name: example-wkr
    type: worker
    run: echo 'work'
    port: 8081
    cpuCores: 0.1
    ramMegabytes: 256
    instances: 1
  - name: example-job
    type: job
    run: echo 'hello world'
    allowConcurrent: true
    cpuCores: 0.1
    ramMegabytes: 256
    cron: '*/10 * * * *'

predeploy:
  run: ls

build:
	method: docker
	context: ./
	dockerfile: ./app/Dockerfile

env:
  NODE_ENV: production
```
