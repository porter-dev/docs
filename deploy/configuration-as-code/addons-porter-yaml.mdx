title: "Deploying Multiple Apps with porter.yaml"
---

You can deploy multiple Porter apps alongside multiple Porter addons in a single `porter.yaml` file. This is particularly useful when you need to deploy related services that work together, such as a web application with its associated database or cache.

<Warning> This feature is in development and is subject to change. </Warning>

### Usage

To enable this feature, set the `PORTER_ADDON_YAML` environment variable while running the apply command.

```bash
PORTER_ADDON_YAML=true porter apply -f porter.yaml
```

## Example Configuration
