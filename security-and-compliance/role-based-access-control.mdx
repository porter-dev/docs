---

Porter supports setting basic authorization permissions via for other members in a Porter project. At the moment, there are 3 roles that can be assigned in a Porter project:

* **Admin:** read/write access to all resources, ability to delete the project and manage team members.
* **Developer:** read/write access to applications, jobs, environment groups, cluster data, and integrations.
* **Viewer:** read access to applications, jobs, environment groups, and cluster data.

## Adding Collaborators[](#adding-collaborators "Direct link to heading")

To add a new collaborator to a Porter project, you must be logged in with an **Admin** role. As an admin, you will see a **Settings** tab in the sidebar. Navigate to **Settings** and input the email of the user you would like to add. This will generate an invitation link for the user, which expires in 24 hours. The user will get an email to join the Porter project, but if the email is not delivered, you can copy the invite link and send it to them directly.

If the user does not have a Porter account, they will be asked to register. After registering, if they are not automatically added to the project, the user should **click the invite link again**.

## Just In Time User Provisioning[](#just-in-time-user-provisioning "Direct link to heading")

To set up just in time user provisioning, you must be logged in with an **Admin** role. As an admin, you can find the setup in **Settings** then **Members** in the sidebar then go to the **SSO** tab. Setting up Just In Time User Provisioning requires your organization to have an Single Sign-On provider configured.

1. To set up Single Sign-On, you can click **Request** under **SSO provisioning** to reach out to support. Single Sign-On is configured by linking your identity provider with our auth provider. 
2. After reaching out to support, set up JIT by going back to the **SSO** tab and click **Set Up** to login with an account. Ensure that you log in with an account connected to your organization.

Once setup, any new users in the same organization will automatically be added to the project without an invite email. By default these users will receive **viewer** role, but you can also configure the default role. You can also click **Update Provider** to set up a different organization.

<Info>
    Users that have been manually removed from the project will need to be manually re-added.
