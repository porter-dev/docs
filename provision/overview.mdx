Porter provisions and manages the underlying infrastructure in your own cloud. During project creation, Porter will prompt you to provision resources in a cloud provider of your choice.

## FAQ[](#faq "Direct link to heading")

### How much does the underlying infrastructure cost?[](#how-much-does-the-underlying-infrastructure-cost "Direct link to heading")

The cost of your infrastructure varies entirely on the amount of resources you use. By default, clusters provisioned by Porter cost around $200 per month.

### What does Porter-provisioned infrastructure consist of?

Infrastructure provisioned by Porter on AWS includes a VPC, a Network Load Balancer, and an EKS cluster. The EKS cluster consists of three node groups: 2 t3.medium instances for system workloads, 1 t3.large instance for the monitoring workloads, and a t3.medium instance for your application workloads that scales based on your usage. On GCP and Azure, the architecture is identical with equivalent components on each cloud provider.
