Porter provisions and manages the underlying infrastructure in your own cloud. During project creation, Porter will prompt you to provision resources in a cloud provider of your choice.

For step by step instructions on how to provision infrastructure in each cloud provider, see the link below.

## FAQ[](#faq "Direct link to heading")

### How much does the underlying infrastructure cost?[](#how-much-does-the-underlying-infrastructure-cost "Direct link to heading")

The cost of your infrastructure varies entirely on the amount of resources you use. By default, clusters provisioned by Porter cost around $200 per month. **All of the underlying infrastructure cost can be covered with your cloud credits from AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.**

### What does Porter-provisioned infrastructure consist of?

Infrastructure provisioned by Porter on AWS includes a VPC, a Network Load Balancer, and an EKS cluster. On GCP and Azure, the architecture is identical with equivalent components on each cloud provider (VPC/VNet, Load Balancer, and managed Kubernetes cluster).

#### Default Node Group Configuration

By default, Porter provisions three node groups in your cluster:

| Node Group | Purpose | AWS Default | Azure Default | GCP Default |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **System** | Kubernetes system workloads | 2x t3.medium | 2x Standard_B2s | 2x e2-medium |
| **Monitoring** | Observability stack (metrics, logs) | 1x t3.large | 1x Standard_B2ms | 1x e2-standard-2 |
| **Application** | Your application workloads | 1x t3.medium (autoscales) | 1x Standard_B2s (autoscales) | 1x e2-medium (autoscales) |

**Application node group details:**
- **Initial size:** 1 node
- **Autoscaling:** Enabled by default
- **Maximum nodes:** Scales based on workload demand and configured limits
- **Minimum nodes:** 1 node to ensure availability

**Disk size:** Each node includes 50GB of disk storage by default across all cloud providers.

<Info>
  You can customize machine types, node counts, and disk sizes after initial provisioning through the Infrastructure tab in the Porter dashboard.
