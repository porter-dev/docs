title: "Deploy a Next.JS App on Azure with Porter"
---

While Porter Cloud's a great way to quickly get started with pushing out your app, there are certain limitations. For one, your app runs on our infrastructure, where there are certain limits on the amount of resources you can use. Further, since it's not your own infrastructure at play, it can be troublesome from a compliance perspective.

That's where Porter Standard comes in - it allows you to experience the same ease-of-use of the Porter experience, but in your _own_ cloud account. You get the flexibility of running your own industry-grade infrastructure, without actually worrying about how it's provisioned or managed - Porter takes care of all those details for you. In this guide, we're going to walk through using Porter to provision infrastructure in an Azure subscription, and then deploy a basic Nodejs app and have it up and running.

Note that to follow this guide, you'll need an account on [Porter Standard](https:/dashboard.getporter.dev) along with an Azure subscription. There is a base charge levied by Azure for a basic cluster provisioned by Porter - this would be around $250 per month, and is subject to change if you run more resource-intensive apps/workloads.

# What We're Deploying

Next.js is an open-source React framework that enables developers to build server-rendered applications, static websites, and more, with an emphasis on performance and ease of use. It leverages the power of React for component-based development and introduces several built-in features such as automatic code splitting, optimized prefetching, and server-side rendering, ensuring that applications are fast and efficient. One of the main advantages of using Next.js is its hybrid rendering capabilities, allowing developers to choose between static generation or server-side rendering on a per-page basis, optimizing both user experience and server resources. Plus it has a vibrant and active community, which means you get access to a wealth of plugins and community expertise

We're going to deploy a sample NextJS server - but that doesn't mean you're restricted to NextJS. You're free to use any and all Nodejs web frameworks (the ExpressJS web framework is also common among Porter users). This app's a very basic app with a single endpoint - ‘/’ to demonstrate how you can push out a public-facing app on Porter with a public facing domain and TLS. The idea here is to show you how a basic app can be quickly deployed on Porter Standard, allowing you to then use the same flow for deploying your code. 

You can find the repository for this sample app here: https://github.com/porter-dev/nextjs-getting-started. Feel free to fork/clone it, or bring your own.

# Getting started

Deploying an app from a Github repository on Porter using Azure involves - broadly - the following steps:

1. Provisioning infrastructure inside your Azure subscription using Porter.
2. Creating a new app on Porter where you specify the repository, the branch, any build settings, as well as what you'd like to run.
3. Building your app and deploying it(automatically handled by Porter).

## Connecting your Azure subscription

On the Porter dashboard, head to `Infrastructure` and select `Azure`. 

![1-msa-service-principal](images/guides/porter-msa/1-msa-service-principal.png)

Here you're required to provide credentials for an Azure Service Principal which allows Porter to access your Azure subscription. You can find details about enabling APIs on your Azure subscription as well as creating a new Service Principal and generating its credentials [here](/provision/provisioning-on-azure).


## Provisioning infrastructure

After connecting your Azure subscription to Porter, you'll see a screen with a form - the fields are pre-filled, with details about your cluster:

![2-msa-cluster-form-setup](images/guides/porter-msa/2-msa-cluster-form.png)

Ordinarily, the only two fields that should be tweaked are the cluster name and the region - feel free to change those. The other fields are usually changed if Porter detects a conflict between the proposed cluster's VPC and other VPCs in your Azure subscription - these would be flagged during a preflight test, allowing you the option of tweaking those addresses. You can also choose a different instance type in this section for your cluster; while we tend to default to `Standard_B2als_v2` instances, we support a lot more instance types. Once you're satisfied, click `Deploy`.

<Info>
  At this stage, Porter will run more extensive preflight checks to ensure your Azure subscription has enough quotas free for components like vCPUs, elastic IPs as well as any potential conflicts with address spaces belonging to other VPCs. If any issues are detected, these will be flagged on the dashboard along with troubleshooting steps.{" "}
</Info>

Deploying your cluster can take up to 20 minutes.

## ​Deployment Process: Creating an App and Connecting Your GitHub Repository

After creating a new project, on the Porter dashboard, select ‘Create a new application’, which opens the following screen:

![image-1](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/1-github-repo.png)

This is where you select a name for your Next.js app and connect a GitHub repository containing your code. Once you've selected the appropriate repository, select the branch you'd like to deploy to Porter. 

<Info>
If you signed up for Porter using an email address instead of a Github account, you can easily connect your Github account to Porter by clicking on the profile icon on the top right corner of the dashboard, selecting ‘Account settings’, and adding your Github account.
</Info>

## Configuration of Build Settings

Porter has the ability to automatically detect what language your app is written in and select an appropriate buildpack that can be used to package your Next.js app for eventual deployment automatically. Once you've selected the branch you wish to use, Porter will display the following screen:

![image-2](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/2-buildpack.png)

You can further tune your build here. For instance, we're going to use the newer ‘heroku/builder:22’ buildpack for our new Next.js app.

## Configuration of services

At this point, taking a quick look at applications and services is a good idea. An application on Porter is a group of services where each service shares the same build and the same environment variables. If your app consists of a single repository with separate modules for, say, an API, a frontend, and a background worker, then you'd deploy a single application on Porter with three separate services. Porter supports three kinds of services: ‘web’, ‘worker’, and ‘job’ services. 

Let's add a single ‘web’ service for our app:

![image-3](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/3-service.png)

## Configure Your Service

Now that we've defined a single web service in the previous steps, it's time to tell Porter how it runs. That means specifying what command to run for this service, what CPU/RAM levels to allocate, and how it will be accessed publicly.

![image-4](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/4-main.png)

You can define what start command you'd like Porter to use to run your app in the ‘Main’ tab. This is required if your app's being built using a buildpack; this may be optional if you opt to use a Docker file(since Porter will assume you have an ‘ENTRYPOINT’ in your Docker file and use that if it exists).

![image-5](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/5-resources.png)

In this section, you can also define the number of replicas you'd like to run for this app and any autoscaling rules—these allow you to instruct Porter to add more replicas if resource utilization crosses a certain threshold. 

![image-6](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/6-networking.png)

The ‘Networking’ tab is where you specify what port your app listens on - since we’ve kept NextJS’s default settings, we’re going to set the port to 8000. When you deploy a web app on Porter, we automatically generate a public URL for you to use - but you can also opt to bring your own domain by adding an A record to your DNS records, pointing your domain at your cluster's public load balancer, and adding the custom domain in this section. This can be done at any point - either while you're creating the app or later once you've deployed it. 

<Info>
If your app listens on ‘localhost’ or ‘127.0.0.1’, Porter won't be able to forward incoming connections and requests to your app. To that end, please ensure your app is configured to listen on ‘0.0.0.0’ instead.
</Info>

## ​Deployment Process: Review and Merge Porter's PR

Hitting ‘Deploy’ will show you the contents of a GitHub Action workflow that Porter would use to build and deploy your Next.js server:

![image-7](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/7-preview-gha.png)

This Github Action is configured to run every time you push a commit to the branch you specified earlier - when it runs, Porter applies the selected buildpack to your code, builds a final image, and pushes that image to Porter. Selecting ‘Deploy app’ will allow Porter to open a PR in your repo, adding this workflow file:

![image-8](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/8-merge-pr.png)

All you need to do is merge this PR, and your build will commence.

![image-9](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/9-view-build.png)

![image-10](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/10-build-logs.png)

You can also use the ‘Activity’ tab on the Porter dashboard to see a timeline of your build going through. Once the build succeeds, you'll also be able to see the deployment in action:

![image-11](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/11-porter-build-status.png)

![image-12](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/12-porter-deployment-status.png)

## Accessing Your App

After completing the previous steps, our new Next.js app's now live on Porter. The Porter-generated unique URL or domain name is now visible on the dashboard under your app's name. Let's test it:

![image-13](/images/guides/porter-cloud-nextjs/13-view-web-app.png)

Porter also provides logging and monitoring in the form of app logs and resource consumption metrics on the dashboard, so you can see how your web application is faring:

### Exploring Further
We've seen how you can deploy a Next.JS project on Porter. Here are a few pointers to help you dive further into configuring/tuning your Next.js application without having to manage your infrastructure/DevOps:

1. [Adding your own domain](/configure/custom-domains).
2. [Adding environment variables and groups](/configure/environment-groups) (environment groups are only available when hosting on Porter Standard).
3. [Scaling your Next.js applications](/configure/autoscaling). 
4. [Ensuring your app's never offline](/configure/health-checks) (we'll renew and manage the SSL certificate for you).
