Cloning an application allows you to quickly replicate your application configuration. This is ideal for setting up staging/development environments or migrating workloads between clusters.

<Note>
  This feature creates a new application with a unique name while copying the original's resource settings and build configuration.

## How to Clone

    Navigate to the **Settings** tab of the application you wish to duplicate and click the **Clone** button in the top right.

  <Step title="Choose Target Cluster">
    Select the target cluster from the dropdown menu. You can clone an app into the same cluster or any other cluster in your project.

## Important Considerations

Before cloning, please be aware of how Porter handles specific configuration items to prevent deployment failures and conflicts between environments:

<Warning>
**The following configurations are reset during cloning:**
* **Environment Variables:** All inline environment variables are removed.
* **Environment Groups:** All synced environment groups are removed.
* **Networking:** External domains are removed to prevent DNS conflicts with the original app.
</Warning>
