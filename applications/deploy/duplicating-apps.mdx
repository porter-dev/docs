Cloning an application allows you to quickly replicate your application configuration. This is ideal for setting up staging/development environments or migrating workloads between clusters.
In addition, this can be used to change the name of an application without having to recreate it.

<Note>
  This feature creates a new application with a unique name while copying the original's resource settings and build configuration.
</Note>

## How to Clone

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to App Settings">
    Navigate to the **Settings** tab of the application you wish to duplicate and click the **Clone** button .

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Target Cluster">
    Select the target cluster from the dropdown menu. You can clone an app into the same cluster or any other cluster in your project.

## Important Considerations

Before cloning an app, please be aware of how specific configuration items are handled to prevent deployment failures and conflicts between environments:

<Warning>
**The following configurations are reset during cloning:**
* **Environment Variables:** All inline environment variables are removed.
* **Environment Groups:** All synced environment groups are removed.
* **Networking:** External domains are removed to prevent DNS conflicts with the original app.
</Warning>

## Common Workflows

### Renaming an Application
Application names cannot be changed once created, but cloning can be used as an alternative to achieve this:
1. Clone the application and give it the **new name**.
2. Update the environment variables and secrets on the new app.
3. Once the new app is verified and healthy, delete the original application.

### Migrating Traffic to a Different Environment
Because external domains are removed during cloning to prevent downtime on the source app, follow these steps to switch traffic:
1. Clone the application and verify it is running correctly.
2. **On the cloned app:** Add the custom domain and redeploy.
3. **On the original app:** Remove the custom domain in the **Networking** tab.

<Warning>
  Migrating a domain may cause disruption in service while DNS changes propagate. If you have additional
  questions reach out to Porter support.
