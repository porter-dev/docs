title: 'App Metadata'

Porter injects some default environment variables in all Porter-provisioned apps, containing basic metadata around your app and the current deployment revision. A full list of these environment variables may be found here:

1. `PORTER_RESOURCES_RAM` - The amount of RAM assigned to the current service.
2. `PORTER_RESOURCES_CPU` - The number of vCPU cores assigned to the current service.
3. `PORTER_RESOURCES_REPLICAS` - The static replica count for the current service. Note that this may differ from the actual number of replicas running, if you have autoscaling enabled.
4. `PORTER_NODE_NAME` - The node the current service replica is running on.
5. `PORTER_NODE_IP` - The internal IP of the node the current service replica is running on.
6. `PORTER_POD_NAME` - This is the same as the internal hostname for the current service replica.
7. `PORTER_POD_IP` - The internal private IP assigned to the current service replica.
8. `PORTER_POD_IMAGE_TAG` - The image tag being used to run the current service replica. This is typically the same as `PORTER_IMAGE_TAG`.
9. `PORTER_IMAGE_TAG` - The image tag being used for the current app. This is typically the same as `PORTER_POD_IMAGE_TAG`.
10. `PORTER_POD_REVISION` - The revision ID assigned to the latest app deployment by Porter.
11. `PORTER_APP_SERVICE_NAME` - A portmanteau of the app name and service name: `<APP>-SERVICE`.
12. `PORTER_DOMAINS` - A comma-separated list of the domains assigned to your service.

If you're looking at adding more metadata to logs or traces, these environment variables can be used to inject metadata about the origin of a log/trace into your observability tooling.
