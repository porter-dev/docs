title: 'Alerts'
---

On critical events such as Application Crash Loop, Out of Memory errors, or non-zero exit codes, Porter will alert you on Slack. 

You can create `Notification Groups` by heading to `Settings` on your Porter project and setting up channels - you can set up email, Slack or PagerDuty. These can then be attached to apps(in any app on the Porter dashboard, head to the `Settings` tab to attach a notification group to that specific app). For advanced and custom alerts, we recommend using a 3rd party addon such as Datadog, Mezmo, or New Relic that you can easily install from the `Addons` tab.
