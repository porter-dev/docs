Porter is a platform as a service (PaaS) that runs in your own cloud. It brings the magical experience of deploying an application with just a few clicks into a cloud provider of your choice, whether that is AWS, GCP, or Azure. Porter will provision and manage the underlying infrastructure for you - simply point at your repository and Porter will handle the rest, from building your application to autoscaling it.
