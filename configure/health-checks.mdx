title: "Health Checks"
---

Health checks verify that your application is ready to receive traffic before old instances are replaced during deployments. This prevents downtime by ensuring new instances are fully operational before traffic is routed to them.

For a complete guide on combining health checks with graceful shutdown, see [Zero-Downtime Deployments](/configure/zero-downtime-deployments).

## Web Services

When your Web service is configured with health checks, Porter will ensure that no traffic is routed to your service unless the specified endpoints return a `200` status code. Health checks can be configured in the **Advanced** tab:

For example, in the screenshot above, no traffic will be routed to the web service until the `/healthz` endpoint returns a `200` status code.

When you push a new update to your application, the old version will not be spun down until the new version passes all health checks. For more details on combining health checks with graceful shutdown, see [Zero-Downtime Deployments](/configure/zero-downtime-deployments).

## Workers

Worker services can use command-based health checks instead of HTTP endpoints. This is useful for services like Celery workers that don't expose HTTP endpoints.

For details on configuring command-based health checks for workers, see [Zero-Downtime Deployments: Workers](/configure/zero-downtime-deployments#workers).
