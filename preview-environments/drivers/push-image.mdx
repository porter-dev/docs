##### info

* This driver requires the [target.app\_name](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourcetarget) field to be set to the Porter release name.
* The [source](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourcesource) section does not need to be set for this driver.

This preview environments driver can be used to push a local Docker image to a linked registry on Porter. The [config](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourceconfig) section, when using this driver, supports the following properties:

* `push` \[`Object`, required\] \- options to push the image, with the following properties:  
   * `use_pack_cache` \[`Boolean`, optional\] \- whether to use the pack cache when pushing the image  
   * `image` \[`String`, required\] \- the name of the local Docker image to push

For example, to push a local Docker image to a linked registry, you can use the following:

```

resources:
  - name: my-pushed-image
    driver: push-image
    target:
      app_name: my-porter-release
    config:
      push:
        image: us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/my-gcp-project/my-gar-repo/my-image:f00bar1
