This preview environments driver can be used to build, push, and deploy an app or addon to Porter. Since this driver does all of this, it is also the default driver. The [config](/preview-environments/porter-yaml-reference#resourceconfig) section, when using this driver, supports the following properties:

* `waitForJob` \[`Boolean`, optional\] \- if set to `true`, the driver will wait for the job to complete before proceeding
* `onlyCreate` \[`Boolean`, optional\] \- if set to `true`, the driver will only create the app or addon but not update it on subsequent runs
* `build` \[`Object`, required\] \- options for the build step, with the following properties:  
   * `useCache` \[`Boolean`, optional\] \- if set to `true`, the driver will use the image cache (if available) for the build

   * `context` \[`String`, optional\] \- the current build context or working directory to use, relative to the root directory. Defaults to the current working directory.  
   * `dockerfile` \[`String`, required only when `method` is `docker`\] \- path to the Dockerfile to use, relative to the root directory  
   * `image` \[`String`, required only when `method` is `registry`\] \- the container image URI to use including the full image path and the tag
