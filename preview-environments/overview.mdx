## Getting Started

Porter offers a simple way to create preview environments for your app. When enabled, preview environments are by default created automatically for every pull request that is opened in your GitHub repository.

A unique URL is generated for each PR that you use to access your app and test changes in a production-like environment before merging. Each preview environment is created in isolation on your cluster and is destroyed once the pull request is closed or merged.

### Enabling Preview Environments

1. Navigate to the **Preview envs** tab on the Porter dashboard.
2. Click the **Request to enable** button to submit a request to enable preview environments.
3. The Porter team will review your request promptly.
