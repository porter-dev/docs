title: "Migrating from Porter Cloud to Porter Standard"
---

Everything about running applications on Porter Cloud remains the same on Porter Standard.

At a high-level, migrating to Porter Standard involves:

1. Provisioning your infrastructure on a Porter Standard project
2. Copying your applications to your new project
3. Cutting over DNS entries from Porter Cloud to your new project

## Provisioning your infrastructure on Porter Standard[](#provisioning "Direct link to heading")

[Create a project](https://dashboard.porter.run) if you haven't already.

You will be prompted to connect a cloud account and provision infrastructure. See our [docs](/provision/overview) for more information.

## Copying applications from Porter Cloud to Porter Standard[](#provisioning "Direct link to heading")

Porter saves your application configuration in a consolidated `porter.yaml` format, which you can use to copy configuration to your new project.

### Exporting your application configuration from Porter Cloud

First, you'll have to save your application configuration as a YAML file on your local device.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CLI">
    Make sure your CLI is authenticated to your Porter Cloud project:
    ```bash
      porter config
    ```
    If the host is not https://cloud.porter.run and/or the project does not match your ID, run the following:
    ```bash
      porter auth login --host https://cloud.porter.run
      porter config set-project
    ```

    Copy your application configuration to a local file by running:
    ```bash
      porter app yaml YOUR_APP > /file/on/your/local
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dashboard">
Navigate to the settings tab of your application:
![App Settings](/images/cloud-migration/app-settings.webp)

Click on the Export button and save the content on a local file:
![App YAML](/images/cloud-migration/app-yaml-compressed.webp)

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
If you have any `onporter.run` domains configured on your services, you will have to remove them from the outputted yaml before continuing:

```
...
  domains:
  - name: web-1237-9889f3a8-r2aac6bv.onporter.run
...
```

</Warning>

<Warning>

If you have configured secret variables in your application environment, these
will not be exported with the app configuration. Run the following to retrieve
all your secret and non-secret variables:

```bash
porter env pull -a YOUR_APP
```

</Warning>

### Creating your application on Porter Standard

    Make sure your CLI is authenticated to your Porter Standard project:
    ```
      porter auth login --host https://dashboard.porter.run
      porter config set-project
    ```

    Run the following to create your application in your new project:
    ```bash
      porter apply -f /file/on/your/local --no-build
    ```

### Push new code changes to Porter Standard

If you are running builds through Porter, you will have to update your Github workflow file to point to the new project.

<Info>
  You can find this workflow file in the `.github` folder in the root of your
  Github repository. Porter generates a workflow file with the prefix
  `porter-app`/`porter_app`, but if you copied the file manually it may have a
  different name.
</Info>

The following variables will have to be updated in the `env` block of the workflow file:

- `PORTER_PROJECT`
- `PORTER_CLUSTER`
- `PORTER_HOST`
- `PORTER_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_ID`
- `PORTER_TOKEN`

![Workflow File Diff](/images/cloud-migration/workflow-file-diff.webp)

To find the updated values for `PORTER_PROJECT`, `PORTER_CLUSTER` and `PORTER_HOST`, run `porter config` after authenticating to Porter Standard and copy the values for `project`, `cluster` and `host`.

If your Github workflow file has the `PORTER_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET_ID` field, you can remove it entirely.

You will have to generate a new API token for `PORTER_TOKEN`:

1. Navigate to the [API Tokens](https://dashboard.porter.run/settings/members) page in the `Settings` tab to generate a new token with the `Developer` role. You must have admin permissions to create API tokens.
2. [Create a new Github secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) with this value
3. Reference the secret key name as the value for `PORTER_TOKEN`

## Move DNS for custom domains to Porter Standard[](#dns "Direct link to heading")

If you rely on any web services being publicly accessible, you will have to update your DNS settings to point to the load balancer associated with your new infrastructure.

You can find your load balancer IP by navigating to your application on the Porter dashboard, going to the `Overview` tab, expanding one of your web services, and going to the `Networking` tab.
