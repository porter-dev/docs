Before creating a new application in Porter, you can specify configuration for your application services by writing a `porter.yaml` file and adding it to your repository. 
Though this file is not required, it can reduce the time it takes to get started with a Porter application. 
Once you start creating your application in Porter and select your Github repository, Porter will automatically read your `porter.yaml` to prepopulate settings for your application services.

## Writing your first `porter.yaml` file

The structure of a `porter.yaml` file is very simple. Application services are specified via the apps key, and each service is given a run command as such:

```
apps:
  my-app-web:
    run: "python app.py" 
  my-app-worker:
    run: "python start-worker.py" 
```

In the file above, we have defined two application services, named `my-app-web` and `my-app-worker`. By default, every service whose name includes `web` will be inferred to be a **Web** type service, and everything else will be inferred to be a **Worker** type service. See [here](/standard/deploying-applications/overview#types-of-applications) for more information about the difference between service types.

You can also explicitly define the type of a service using the type key:

```
apps:
  my-app-web:
    type: web
    run: "python app.py" 
  my-app-worker:
    type: worker
    run: "python start-worker.py"     
```

After writing a file like the above, naming it `porter.yaml`, and adding it to your Github repository, you are all set to create an application in Porter!

## Writing your second (and nth) porter.yaml file

You can also specify more advanced configuration in your `porter.yaml` file. Two common configuration options are **Resources** and **Pre-deploy**.

## Resources

You can specify RAM and CPU allocated to your services like so:

```
apps:
  my-app-web:
    run: "python app.py" 
    config:
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
  my-app-worker:
    run: "python start-worker.py"
```

In the example above, the my-app-web service is allocated 100m CPU and 128Mi RAM.

## Pre-deploy

A pre-deploy command is a command that is run before your application services are deployed. This is useful for running database migrations, for example. You can specify a pre-deploy command like so:

```
apps:
  my-app-web:
    run: "python app.py" 
  my-app-worker:
    run: "python start-worker.py" 

release:
  run: "python manage.py migrate"
```

If you require more resources to run this command, you may also specify resources for the job that runs your pre-deploy command, similar to any other service:

```
apps:
  my-app-web:
    run: "python app.py" 
  my-app-worker:
    run: "python start-worker.py"

release:
  run: "python manage.py migrate"
  config:
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 128Mi
```
