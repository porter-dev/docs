`porter auth` contains commands for authenticating with Porter.

## `porter auth login`

Authenticate with your Porter account. By default, this opens your browser to complete authentication.

**Usage:**
```bash
porter auth login [flags]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--manual` | Log in by entering email and password instead of browser auth |
| `--token` | Log in using an existing token |

<CodeGroup>
```bash Browser Login (Default)
porter auth login
```

```bash Manual Login
porter auth login --manual
```

```bash Token Login
porter auth login --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
After logging in, Porter automatically sets your default project and cluster if you have access to any. You can view these with `porter config`.

## `porter auth logout`

Log out from Porter and clear your local credentials.

**Usage:**
```bash
porter auth logout

<Tip>
After logging out, you'll need to run `porter auth login` again before using other commands.
