`porter config` contains commands for controlling local configuration settings.

### `porter config`[](#porter-config "Direct link to heading")

Running `porter config` with no subcommands will output the current configuration file to the terminal. Note that this configuration may be overwritten through a combination of flags and environment variables.

### `porter config set-host [HOSTNAME]`[](#porter-config-set-host-hostname "Direct link to heading")

Saves the host in the default configuration. Note this host must include the protocol and should not contain trailing slashes. For example:

```
porter config set-host https://dashboard.porter.run
```

### `porter config set-project`[](#porter-config-set-project "Direct link to heading")

Saves the project ID in the default configuration from a list of projects that you have access to.

### `porter config set-cluster`[](#porter-config-set-cluster "Direct link to heading")

Saves the cluster ID in the default configuration from a list of clusters that the current project has access to.
