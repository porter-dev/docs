---

`porter app` contains commands for managing and interacting with your applications.

## Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/standard/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/standard/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
- You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/standard/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

## `porter app run`

Runs a command inside your application's environment. By default, this spins up an ephemeral copy of your application that is deleted when the command completes.

**Usage:**
```bash
porter app run [application] -- COMMAND [args...] [flags]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--existing_pod` | `-e` | Connect to an existing pod instead of spinning up a new one (default: false) |
| `--container` | `-c` | Name of the container inside pod to run the command in |
| `--interactive` | | Run in interactive mode (default: false) |
| `--job` | | Name of the job to run (runs the job as defined and returns the job run ID without waiting) |
| `--wait` | | Wait for the command to complete before exiting for non-interactive mode (default: false) |
| `--allow-concurrent` | | Allow concurrent job runs when using `--job` (overrides job config if concurrency is disabled) |
| `--cpu` | | CPU allocation in millicores (1000 millicores = 1 vCPU) |
| `--ram` | | RAM allocation in Mi (1024 Mi = 1 GB) |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Print verbose output |

<CodeGroup>
```bash Interactive Shell
porter app run my-app -- bash
```

```bash Existing Container
porter app run my-app -e -- bash
```

```bash Trigger Job
porter app run my-app --job my-job
```

```bash Wait for Job
porter app run my-app --job my-job --wait
```

```bash Concurrent Job
porter app run my-app --job my-job --allow-concurrent
```

```bash Run Command
porter app run my-app -- python manage.py migrate
```

```bash Custom Resources
porter app run my-app --cpu 500 --ram 512 -- python heavy_script.py
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
If `bash` isn't available in your container, try `sh` for a similar interactive experience.
</Info>

## `porter app run cleanup`

Delete any lingering ephemeral pods that were created with `porter app run`.

**Usage:**
```bash
porter app run cleanup
```

---

## `porter app logs`

porter app logs [application] [flags]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--service` | The name of the service to get logs for |
| `--search` | Search for a specific string in the logs |
| `--revision` | The revision number to get logs for (default: -1, no filter applied) |

**Historical Log Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--since` | Lookback period from the current time to get historical logs (e.g., `12h`, `30m`) |
| `--from` | Start time (UTC) for historical logs (format: `2021-01-01T00:00:00Z`) |
| `--to` | End time (UTC) for historical logs (format: `2021-01-01T00:00:00Z`) |
| `--limit` | Number of lines of historical logs to return |
| `--newest-first` | Return newest historical logs first (default: true) |

<CodeGroup>
```bash Stream Live Logs
porter app logs my-app
```

```bash Filter by Service
porter app logs my-app --service web
```

```bash Search Logs
porter app logs my-app --search "error"
```

```bash Historical Logs
porter app logs my-app --since 12h
```

```bash Time Range
porter app logs my-app --from 2025-01-15T10:00:00Z --to 2025-01-15T12:00:00Z
```

```bash Limit Results
porter app logs my-app --since 24h --limit 500
