##### Prerequisites

- You've logged in to the Porter CLI after running [porter auth login](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-auth)
- You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)
- You're connected to the correct cluster by running [porter config set-cluster](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

### `porter app run`[](#porter-run 'Direct link to heading')

The `porter app run` command allows users to execute a command on a remote container:

```
porter app run [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

The `APP_NAME` is the name of the application on the Porter dashboard.

Running `porter app run` spins up an ephemeral copy of your application
container. This container will be deleted when your command completes,
or when you exit your interactive shell session.

To connect to an existing running container, you can specify the `-e` flag:

```
porter app run -e [APP_NAME] -- [COMMAND] [args...]
```

**Common Usage** [](#porter-run-examples 'Direct link to heading')

```
porter app run [APP_NAME] -- bash
```

This will launch an interactive shell session through which you can run other commands, like `ls`, `ps`, etc. If `bash` isn't found on your container, you can also try `sh` for a similar result.

### `porter app logs`[](#porter-logs 'Direct link to heading')

The `porter app logs` command allows users to stream logs from their application:

```
porter app logs [APP_NAME]
```

The `--service` flag can be used to stream logs from a specific service in the application:

```
porter app logs [APP_NAME] --service [SERVICE_NAME]
```

### `porter app build`[](#porter-build 'Direct link to heading')

The `porter app build` command builds a new container image for an app based on it's existing build settings. Any build setting can be overridden with a corresponding flag.

For example, to start a Docker build for an app in the `./frontend` directory, you can run:

```
porter app build [APP_NAME] --build-context ./frontend --dockerfile ./frontend/Dockerfile
```

### `porter app push`[](#porter-push 'Direct link to heading')

The `porter app push` command pushes a container image to the default registry for the app. This command can be used with the `app build` command to build and push an image as discrete steps.

The `--tag` flag can be used to specify the image tag to push. Otherwise, the head of the current branch will be used as the tag.

```
porter app push [APP_NAME] --tag [TAG]
```

### `porter app update`[](#porter-update 'Direct link to heading')

The `porter app update` command updates the specified app with the provided configuration. This command differs from "porter apply" in that it only updates the app, but does not attempt to build a new image. This is similar to updating the app in the Porter dashboard.

```
porter app update [APP_NAME] -f porter.yaml
```

### `porter app update-tag`[](#porter-update-tag 'Direct link to heading')

`porter app update-tag` updates the image of the specified application with the tag provided by the `--tag` flag. For example:

```
porter app update-tag <YOUR_APP_NAME> --tag <GITHUB_SHA>
```

This command is functionally equivalent to running either `porter apply` or `porter app update` with the `--tag` flag.
