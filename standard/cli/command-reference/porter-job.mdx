## `porter job runs`

View job runs with optional filters. Results are sorted by creation time, with the most recent runs first.

**Usage:**
```bash
porter job runs [flags]
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--job` | Filter by job name |
| `--app` | Filter by application name |
| `--revision` | Filter by revision number (requires `--app`) |
| `--target` | Filter by deployment target (use `ALL` for all targets) |
| `--status` | Filter by status (`running`, `succeeded`, `failed`) |
| `--limit` | Maximum number of runs to return (default: 100) |

<CodeGroup>
```bash All Recent Runs
porter job runs
```

```bash Filter by Job Name
porter job runs --job cleanup-job
```

```bash Filter by App
porter job runs --app my-app
```

```bash Filter by Status
porter job runs --status failed
```

```bash Combined Filters
porter job runs --app my-app --job migration --status succeeded --limit 10
```

```bash All Targets
porter job runs --target ALL
```
</CodeGroup>

**Example Output:**
```
ID          JOB             APP         STATUS      STARTED              DURATION

```

## Triggering Jobs

To manually trigger a job run, use `porter app run`:

```bash
porter app run my-app --job my-job --wait
```

<Tip>
Use `--wait` to block until the job completes, which is useful in CI/CD pipelines.
