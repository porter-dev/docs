##### Prerequisites

- You're connected to the correct project by running [porter config set-project](/enterprise/cli/command-reference/porter-config)

### `porter job runs`[](#porter-job-runs 'Direct link to heading')

The `porter job runs` command allows users to view the job runs for a project, with optional filters applied. The returned job runs will be sorted by creation time, with the most recent job runs appearing first.

```
porter job runs [JOB_NAME]
```

The following flags can be used to filter the job runs:

```yaml
# --job:
# filter job runs by job name
porter job runs --job [JOB_NAME]

# --app:
# filter job runs by application name
porter job runs --app [APP_NAME]

# --revision:
# filter job runs by revision number (requires --app)
porter job runs --app [APP_NAME] --revision [REVISION_NUMBER]

# --target:
# filter job runs by deployment target
porter job runs --target [TARGET_NAME]

# --status:
# filter job runs by status
porter job runs --status [STATUS]

# --limit:
# limit the number of job runs returned, defaults to 100
porter job runs --limit [LIMIT]
```
