title: "Basic Usage"
---

To set up and authenticate with the CLI, run the following command:

```
porter auth login
```

This command will automatically set a project ID and a cluster ID in your default configuration file, if you have a project and cluster. You can always view your default configuration by running `porter config`. You can see all projects that you have access to by running:

```
porter projects list
```

And you can set a project via:

```
porter config set-project [PROJECT_ID]
```

Next, you can see all clusters that you have access to via:

```
porter clusters list
```

And similarly, you can set the cluster:

```
porter config set-cluster [CLUSTER_ID]
```

## Environment Variables and Global Flags[](#environment-variables-and-global-flags "Direct link to heading")

The following environment variables can be set in order to authenticate to and target a specific Porter project or cluster:

```
PORTER_PROJECT
PORTER_CLUSTER
PORTER_TOKEN
```

These are also supported as global flags:

```
--cluster uint   cluster ID of Porter cluster
--project uint   project ID of Porter project
--token string   token for Porter authentication
```

## Viewing Help Instructions[](#viewing-help-instructions "Direct link to heading")

You can view help instructions for any command via the `-h`, or `--help` flag. For example:

```
porter -h
porter cluster -h
```
